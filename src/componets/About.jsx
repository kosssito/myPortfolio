                Full Stack Developer

              <h2>üëã Who am I?</h2>
              <p>
                Graduated in full stack web development at soyHenry (PERN stack).
                I like solving problems and creating tools that
                they make life easier. I discovered the world of programming through
                through JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I decided to sign up for the
                Henry's bootcamp, in which I was able to learn and deepen a lot
                about code, technologies, and also the importance of work
                team up. What I like most about this world is that there is so much
                to learn, and that is a great motivation trigger for me
                curiosity. ü§ìüß†üöÄ
              </p>
              <h2>‚è™ Where do I come from?</h2>
              <p>
                Work as Deliver, and I worked for five years in
                various Deliver Applications, which always gave me
                curious about how they worked and thought that if I knew
                program, could give solutions to errors that these same
                applications sometimes had.
              </p>
              <h2>üî≠ Where am I going?</h2>
              <p>
                Wherever I can contribute solutions through code.
                I believe that the destination is not a place to arrive, but a
                way of transit I choose those processes where I feel
                safe but challenged, demanded but also cared for and rewarded.
              </p>
              <h2>   What technologies and languages ‚Äã‚Äãdo I use?</h2>
              <p>
                JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, Express, React, Redux, Sequelize,
                PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Bootstrap.
